# Adam Bucholtz's Portfolio

This is a React + Vite + Flowbite framework website designed for architecture student Adam Bucholtz.
The goal of this project was to gain more experience in front-end development and provide a portfolio for my brother to use for internships.

Built and deployed using npm and github pages, here is the link to the website: https://adambucholtz.github.io/Portfolio/
(On my brother's account for his personal use)
